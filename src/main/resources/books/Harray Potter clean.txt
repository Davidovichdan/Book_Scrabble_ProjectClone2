THE BOY WHO LIVED MR AND MRS DURSLEY OF NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE WERE PROUD TO SAY THAT THEY WERE PERFECTLY NORMAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEY WERE THE LAST PEOPLE YOUD EXPECT TO BE INVOLVED IN ANYTHING STRANGE OR MYSTERIOUS BECAUSE THEY JUST DIDNT HOLD WITH SUCH NONSENSE MR DURSLEY WAS THE DIRECTOR OF FIRM CALLED GRUNNINGS WHICH MADE DRILLS HE WAS BIG BEEFY MAN WITH HARDLY ANY NECK ALTHOUGH HE DID HAVE VERY LARGE MUSTACHE MRS DURSLEY WAS THIN AND BLONDE AND HAD NEARLY TWICE THE USUAL AMOUNT OF NECK WHICH CAME IN VERY USEFUL AS SHE SPENT SO MUCH OF HER TIME CRANING OVER GARDEN FENCES SPYING ON THE NEIGHBORS THE DURSLEY HAD SMALL SON CALLED DUDLEY AND IN THEIR OPINION THERE WAS NO FINER BOY ANYWHERE THE DURSLEYS HAD EVERYTHING THEY WANTED BUT THEY ALSO HAD SECRET AND THEIR GREATEST FEAR WAS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD DISCOVER IT THEY DIDNT THINK THEY COULD BEAR IT IF ANYONE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE POTTERS MRS POTTER WAS MRS DURSLEYS SISTER BUT THEY HADNT PAGE HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING MET FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN FACT MRS DURSLEY PRETENDED SHE DIDNT HAVE SISTER BECAUSE HER SISTER AND HER GOODFORNOTHING HUSBAND WERE AS UNDURSLEYISH AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE THE DURSLEYS SHUDDERED TO THINK WHAT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY IF THE POTTERS ARRIVED IN THE STREET THE DURSLEYS KNEW THAT THE POTTERS HAD SMALL SON TOO BUT THEY HAD NEVER EVEN SEEN HIM THIS BOY WAS ANOTHER GOOD REASON FOR KEEPING THE POTTERS AWAY THEY DIDNT WANT DUDLEY MIXING WITH CHILD LIKE THAT WHEN MR AND MRS DURSLEY WOKE UP ON THE DULL GRAY TUESDAY OUR STORY STARTS THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT THE CLOUDY SKY OUTSIDE TO SUGGEST THAT STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS THINGS WOULD SOON BE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY MR DURSLEY HUMMED AS HE PICKED OUT HIS MOST BORING TIE FOR WORK AND MRS DURSLEY GOSSIPED AWAY HAPPILY AS SHE WRESTLED SCREAMING DUDLEY INTO HIS HIGH CHAIR NONE OF THEM NOTICED LARGE TAWNY OWL FLUTTER PAST THE WINDOW AT HALF PAST EIGHT MR DURSLEY PICKED UP HIS BRIEFCASE PECKED MRS DURSLEY ON THE CHEEK AND TRIED TO KISS DUDLEY GOODBYE BUT MISSED BECAUSE DUDLEY WAS NOW HAVING TANTRUM AND THROWING HIS CEREAL AT THE WALLS LITTLE TYKE CHORTLED MR DURSLEY AS HE LEFT THE HOUSE HE GOT INTO HIS CAR AND BACKED OUT OF NUMBER FOURS DRIVE IT WAS ON THE CORNER OF THE STREET THAT HE NOTICED THE FIRST SIGN OF SOMETHING PECULIAR CAT READING MAP FOR SECOND MR DURSLEY DIDNT REALIZE WHAT HE HAD SEEN THEN HE

WAS NOW READING THE SIGN THAT SAID PRIVET DRIVE NO LOOKING AT THE SIGN CATS COULDNT READ MAPS OR SIGNS MR DURSLEY GAVE HIMSELF LITTLE SHAKE AND PUT THE CAT OUT OF HIS MIND AS HE DROVE TOWARD TOWN HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING EXCEPT LARGE ORDER OF DRILLS HE WAS HOPING TO GET THAT DAY BUT ON THE EDGE OF TOWN DRILLS WERE DRIVEN OUT OF HIS MIND BY SOMETHING ELSE AS HE SAT IN THE USUAL MORNING TRAFFIC JAM HE COULDNT HELP NOTICING THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE LOT OF STRANGELY DRESSED PEOPLE ABOUT PEOPLE IN CLOAKS MR DURSLEY COULDNT BEAR PEOPLE WHO DRESSED IN FUNNY CLOTHES THE GETUPS YOU SAW ON YOUNG PEOPLE HE SUPPOSED THIS WAS SOME STUPID NEW FASHION HE DRUMMED HIS FINGERS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND HIS EYES FELL ON HUDDLE OF THESE WEIRDOS STANDING QUITE CLOSE BY THEY WERE WHISPERING EXCITEDLY TOGETHER MR DURSLEY WAS ENRAGED TO SEE THAT COUPLE OF THEM WERENT YOUNG AT ALL WHY THAT MAN HAD TO BE OLDER THAN HE WAS AND WEARING AN EMERALDGREEN CLOAK THE NERVE OF HIM BUT THEN IT STRUCK MR DURSLEY THAT THIS

HALLOWEEN MALFOY COULDNT BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW THAT HARRY AND RON WERE STILL AT HOGWARTS THE NEXT DAY LOOKING TIRED BUT PERFECTLY CHEERFUL INDEED BY THE NEXT MORNING HARRY AND RON THOUGHT THAT

GRINGOTTS TO HOGWARTS AND THEY SPENT LOT OF TIME WONDERING WHAT COULD POSSIBLY NEED SUCH HEAVY PROTECTION ITS EITHER REALLY VALUABLE OR REALLY DANGEROUS SAID RON OR BOTH SAID HARRY BUT AS ALL THEY KNEW FOR SURE ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT WAS THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG THEY DIDNT HAVE MUCH CHANCE OF GUESSING WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT FURTHER CLUES PAGE 183 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING NEITHER NEVILLE NOR HERMIONE SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN WHAT LAY UNDERNEATH THE DOG AND THE TRAPDOOR ALL NEVILLE CARED ABOUT WAS NEVER GOING NEAR THE DOG AGAIN HERMIONE WAS NOW

FLUTTERED OUT OF THE WAY WHEN ANOTHER OWL DROPPED LETTER ON TOP OF THE PARCEL HARRY RIPPED OPEN THE LETTER FIRST WHICH WAS LUCKY BECAUSE IT SAID DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE IT CONTAINS YOUR NEW NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND BUT DONT WANT EVERYBODY KNOWING YOUVE GOT BROOMSTICK OR THEYLL ALL WANT ONE OLIVER WOOD WILL MEET YOU TONIGHT ON THE QUIDDITCH FIELD AT SEVEN OCLOCK FOR YOUR FIRST TRAINING

NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND SIR SAID HARRY FIGHTING NOT TO LAUGH AT THE LOOK OF HORROR ON MALFOYS FACE AND ITS REALLY THANKS TO MALFOY HERE THAT IVE GOT IT HE ADDED HARRY AND RON HEADED UPSTAIRS SMOTHERING THEIR LAUGHTER AT MALFOYS OBVIOUS RAGE AND CONFUSION WELL ITS TRUE HARRY CHORTLED AS THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE MARBLE STAIRCASE IF HE HADNT STOLEN NEVILLES REMEMBRALL WOULDNT BE ON THE TEAM SO SUPPOSE YOU THINK THATS REWARD FOR BREAKING RULES CAME AN ANGRY VOICE FROM JUST BEHIND THEM HERMIONE WAS STOMPING UP THE STAIRS LOOKING DISAPPROVINGLY AT THE PACKAGE IN HARRYS HAND THOUGHT YOU WERENT SPEAKING TO US SAID HARRY YES DONT STOP NOW SAID RON ITS DOING US SO MUCH GOOD HERMIONE MARCHED AWAY WITH HER NOSE IN THE AIR HARRY HAD LOT OF TROUBLE KEEPING HIS MIND ON HIS LESSONS THAT DAY IT KEPT WANDERING UP TO THE DORMITORY WHERE HIS NEW BROOMSTICK WAS LYING UNDER HIS BED OR STRAYING OFF TO THE QUIDDITCH FIELD WHERE HED BE LEARNING TO PLAY THAT NIGHT HE BOLTED HIS DINNER THAT EVENING WITHOUT NOTICING WHAT HE WAS EATING AND THEN RUSHED UPSTAIRS WITH RON TO UNWRAP THE NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND AT LAST WOW RON SIGHED AS THE BROOMSTICK ROLLED ONTO HARRYS BEDSPREAD EVEN HARRY WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT BROOMS THOUGHT IT LOOKED WONDERFUL SLEEK AND SHINY WITH MAHOGANY HANDLE IT HAD LONG TAIL OF PAGE 186 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING NEAT STRAIGHT TWIGS AND NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND WRITTEN IN GOLD NEAR THE TOP AS SEVEN OCLOCK DREW NEARER HARRY LEFT THE CASTLE AND SET OFF IN THE DUSK TOWARD THE QUIDDITCH FIELD HED NEVER BEEN INSIDE THE STADIUM BEFORE HUNDREDS OF SEATS WERE RAISED IN STANDS AROUND THE FIELD SO THAT THE SPECTATORS WERE HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AT EITHER END OF THE FIELD WERE THREE GOLDEN POLES WITH HOOPS ON THE END THEY REMINDED HARRY OF THE LITTLE PLASTIC STICKS MUGGLE CHILDREN BLEW BUBBLES THROUGH EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE FIFTY FEET HIGH TOO EAGER TO FLY AGAIN TO WAIT FOR WOOD HARRY MOUNTED HIS BROOMSTICK AND KICKED OFF FROM THE GROUND WHAT FEELING HE SWOOPED IN AND OUT OF THE GOAL POSTS AND THEN SPED UP AND DOWN THE FIELD THE NIMBUS TWO THOUSAND TURNED WHEREVER HE WANTED AT HIS LIGHTEST TOUCH HEY POTTER COME DOWN OLIVER WOOD HAD ARRIVED HE WAS CARRYING LARGE WOODEN CRATE UNDER HIS ARM HARRY LANDED NEXT TO HIM VERY NICE SAID WOOD HIS EYES GLINTING SEE WHAT MCGONAGALL MEANT YOU REALLY ARE NATURAL IM JUST GOING TO TEACH YOU THE RULES THIS EVENING THEN YOULL BE JOINING TEAM PRACTICE THREE TIMES WEEK HE OPENED THE CRATE INSIDE WERE FOUR DIFFERENTSIZED BALLS RIGHT SAID WOOD NOW QUIDDITCH IS EASY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND EVEN IF ITS NOT TOO EASY TO PLAY THERE ARE SEVEN PLAYERS ON EACH SIDE THREE OF THEM ARE CALLED CHASERS PAGE 187 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING THREE CHASERS HARRY REPEATED AS WOOD TOOK OUT BRIGHT RED BALL ABOUT THE SIZE OF SOCCER BALL THIS BALLS CALLED THE QUAFFLE SAID WOOD THE CHASERS THROW THE QUAFFLE TO EACH OTHER AND TRY AND GET IT THROUGH ONE OF THE HOOPS TO SCORE GOAL TEN POINTS EVERY TIME THE QUAFFLE GOES THROUGH ONE OF THE HOOPS FOLLOW ME THE CHASERS THROW THE QUAFFLE AND PUT IT THROUGH THE HOOPS TO SCORE HARRY RECITED SO THATS SORT OF LIKE BASKETBALL ON BROOMSTICKS WITH SIX HOOPS ISNT IT WHATS BASKETBALL SAID WOOD CURIOUSLY NEVER MIND SAID HARRY QUICKLY NOW THERES ANOTHER PLAYER ON EACH SIDE WHOS CALLED THE KEEPER IM KEEPER FOR GRYFFINDOR HAVE TO FLY AROUND OUR HOOPS AND STOP THE OTHER TEAM FROM SCORING THREE CHASERS ONE KEEPER SAID HARRY WHO WAS DETERMINED TO REMEMBER IT ALL AND THEY PLAY WITH THE QUAFFLE OKAY GOT THAT SO WHAT ARE THEY FOR HE POINTED AT THE THREE BALLS LEFT INSIDE THE BOX ILL SHOW YOU NOW SAID WOOD TAKE THIS HE HANDED HARRY SMALL CLUB BIT LIKE SHORT BASEBALL BAT IM GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE BLUDGERS DO WOOD SAID THESE TWO ARE THE BLUDGERS HE SHOWED HARRY TWO IDENTICAL BALLS JET BLACK AND SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE RED QUAFFLE HARRY NOTICED PAGE 188 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE STRAINING TO ESCAPE THE STRAPS HOLDING THEM INSIDE THE BOX STAND BACK WOOD WARNED HARRY HE BENT DOWN AND FREED ONE OF THE BLUDGERS AT ONCE THE BLACK BALL ROSE HIGH IN THE AIR AND THEN PELTED STRAIGHT AT HARRYS FACE HARRY SWUNG AT IT WITH THE BAT TO STOP IT FROM BREAKING HIS NOSE AND SENT IT ZIGZAGGING AWAY INTO THE AIR IT ZOOMED AROUND THEIR HEADS AND THEN SHOT AT WOOD WHO DIVED ON TOP OF IT AND MANAGED TO PIN IT TO THE GROUND SEE WOOD PANTED FORCING THE STRUGGLING BLUDGER BACK INTO THE CRATE AND STRAPPING IT DOWN SAFELY THE BLUDGERS ROCKET AROUND TRYING TO KNOCK PLAYERS OFF THEIR BROOMS THATS WHY YOU HAVE TWO BEATERS ON EACH TEAM THE WEASLEY TWINS ARE OURS ITS THEIR JOB TO PROTECT THEIR SIDE FROM THE BLUDGERS AND TRY AND KNOCK THEM TOWARD THE OTHER TEAM SO THINK YOUVE GOT ALL THAT THREE CHASERS TRY AND SCORE WITH THE QUAFFLE THE KEEPER GUARDS THE GOAL POSTS THE BEATERS KEEP THE BLUDGERS AWAY FROM THEIR TEAM HARRY REELED OFF VERY GOOD SAID WOOD ER HAVE THE BLUDGERS EVER KILLED ANYONE HARRY ASKED HOPING HE SOUNDED OFFHAND NEVER AT HOGWARTS WEVE HAD COUPLE OF BROKEN JAWS BUT NOTHING WORSE THAN THAT NOW THE LAST MEMBER OF THE TEAM IS THE SEEKER THATS YOU AND YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE QUAFFLE OR THE BLUDGERS UNLESS THEY CRACK MY HEAD OPEN PAGE 189 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING DONT WORRY THE WEASLEYS ARE MORE THAN MATCH FOR THE BLUDGERS MEAN THEYRE LIKE PAIR OF HUMAN BLUDGERS THEMSELVES WOOD REACHED INTO THE CRATE AND TOOK OUT THE FOURTH AND LAST BALL COMPARED WITH THE QUAFFLE AND THE BLUDGERS IT WAS TINY ABOUT THE SIZE OF LARGE WALNUT IT WAS BRIGHT GOLD AND HAD LITTLE FLUTTERING SILVER WINGS THIS SAID WOOD IS THE GOLDEN SNITCH AND ITS THE MOST IMPORTANT BALL OF THE LOT ITS VERY HARD TO CATCH BECAUSE ITS SO FAST AND DIFFICULT TO SEE ITS THE SEEKERS JOB TO CATCH IT YOUVE GOT TO WEAVE IN AND OUT OF THE CHASERS BEATERS BLUDGERS AND QUAFFLE TO GET IT BEFORE THE OTHER TEAMS SEEKER BECAUSE WHICHEVER SEEKER CATCHES THE SNITCH WINS HIS TEAM AN EXTRA HUNDRED AND FIFTY POINTS SO THEY NEARLY ALWAYS WIN THATS WHY SEEKERS GET FOULED SO MUCH GAME OF QUIDDITCH ONLY ENDS WHEN THE SNITCH IS CAUGHT SO IT CAN GO ON FOR AGES THINK THE RECORD IS THREE MONTHS THEY HAD TO KEEP BRINGING ON SUBSTITUTES SO THE PLAYERS COULD GET SOME SLEEP WELL THATS IT ANY QUESTIONS HARRY SHOOK HIS HEAD HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE HAD TO DO ALL RIGHT IT WAS DOING IT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM WE WONT PRACTICE WITH THE SNITCH YET SAID WOOD CAREFULLY SHUTTING IT BACK INSIDE THE CRATE ITS TOO DARK WE MIGHT LOSE IT LETS TRY YOU OUT WITH FEW OF THESE HE PULLED BAG OF ORDINARY GOLF BALLS OUT OF HIS POCKET AND FEW MINUTES LATER HE AND HARRY WERE UP IN THE AIR WOOD THROWING THE GOLF BALLS AS HARD AS HE COULD IN EVERY DIRECTION FOR HARRY TO CATCH PAGE 190 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING HARRY DIDNT MISS SINGLE ONE AND WOOD WAS DELIGHTED AFTER HALF AN HOUR NIGHT HAD REALLY FALLEN AND THEY COULDNT CARRY ON THAT QUIDDITCH CUPLL HAVE OUR NAME ON IT THIS YEAR SAID WOOD HAPPILY AS THEY TRUDGED BACK UP TO THE CASTLE WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF YOU TURN OUT BETTER THAN CHARLIE WEASLEY AND HE COULD HAVE PLAYED FOR ENGLAND IF HE HADNT GONE OFF CHASING DRAGONS PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS NOW SO BUSY WHAT WITH QUIDDITCH PRACTICE THREE EVENINGS WEEK ON TOP OF ALL HIS HOMEWORK BUT HARRY COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HED ALREADY BEEN AT HOGWARTS TWO MONTHS THE CASTLE FELT MORE LIKE HOME THAN PRIVET DRIVE EVER HAD HIS LESSONS TOO WERE BECOMING MORE AND MORE INTERESTING NOW THAT THEY HAD MASTERED THE BASICS ON HALLOWEEN MORNING THEY WOKE TO THE DELICIOUS SMELL OF BAKING PUMPKIN WAFTING THROUGH THE CORRIDORS EVEN BETTER PROFESSOR FLITWICK ANNOUNCED IN CHARMS THAT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE READY TO START MAKING OBJECTS FLY SOMETHING THEY HAD ALL BEEN DYING TO TRY SINCE THEYD SEEN HIM MAKE NEVILLES TOAD ZOOM AROUND THE CLASSROOM PROFESSOR FLITWICK PUT THE CLASS INTO PAIRS TO PRACTICE HARRYS PARTNER WAS SEAMUS FINNIGAN WHICH WAS RELIEF BECAUSE NEVILLE HAD BEEN TRYING TO CATCH HIS EYE RON HOWEVER WAS TO BE WORKING WITH HERMIONE GRANGER IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHETHER RON OR HERMIONE WAS ANGRIER ABOUT THIS SHE HADNT SPOKEN TO

SEE HERE MISS GRANGERS DONE IT RON WAS IN VERY BAD MOOD BY THE END OF THE CLASS ITS NO WONDER NO ONE CAN STAND HER HE SAID TO HARRY AS THEY PUSHED THEIR WAY INTO THE CROWDED CORRIDOR SHES NIGHTMARE HONESTLY PAGE 192 HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING SOMEONE KNOCKED INTO HARRY AS THEY HURRIED PAST HIM IT WAS HERMIONE HARRY CAUGHT GLIMPSE OF HER FACE AND WAS STARTLED TO SEE THAT

DID NOT ANSWER HARRYS QUESTION THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE TREES IN SILENCE FOR SO LONG THAT HARRY THOUGHT FIRENZE DIDNT WANT TO TALK TO HIM ANYMORE THEY WERE PASSING THROUGH PARTICULARLY DENSE PATCH OF TREES HOWEVER WHEN FIRENZE SUDDENLY STOPPED HARRY POTTER DO YOU KNOW WHAT UNICORN BLOOD IS USED FOR NO SAID HARRY STARTLED BY THE ODD QUESTION WEVE ONLY USED THE HORN AND TAIL HAIR IN POTIONS THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS MONSTROUS THING TO SLAY UNICORN SAID FIRENZE ONLY ONE WHO HAS NOTHING TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN WOULD COMMIT SUCH CRIME THE BLOOD OF UNICORN WILL KEEP YOU ALIVE EVEN IF YOU ARE AN INCH FROM DEATH BUT AT TERRIBLE PRICE YOU HAVE SLAIN SOMETHING PURE AND DEFENSELESS TO SAVE YOURSELF AND YOU WILL HAVE BUT HALFLIFE CURSED LIFE FROM THE MOMENT THE BLOOD TOUCHES YOUR LIPS HARRY

PHILOSOPHERS STONE JK ROWLING GOOD LUCK HARRY POTTER SAID FIRENZE THE PLANETS HAVE BEEN READ WRONGLY BEFORE NOW EVEN BY CENTAURS HOPE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES HE TURNED AND CANTERED BACK INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST LEAVING HARRY SHIVERING BEHIND HIM RON HAD FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE DARK COMMON ROOM WAITING FOR THEM TO RETURN HE SHOUTED SOMETHING ABOUT QUIDDITCH FOULS WHEN HARRY ROUGHLY SHOOK HIM AWAKE IN MATTER OF SECONDS THOUGH HE WAS WIDE EYED AS HARRY BEGAN TO TELL HIM AND HERMIONE WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE FOREST HARRY COULDNT SIT DOWN HE PACED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE FIRE HE WAS STILL

NEVILLE THOUGHT HARRY HAD BAD CASE OF EXAM NERVES BECAUSE HARRY COULDNT SLEEP BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT HARRY KEPT BEING WOKEN BY HIS OLD NIGHTMARE EXCEPT THAT IT WAS NOW WORSE THAN EVER BECAUSE THERE WAS HOODED FIGURE DRIPPING BLOOD IN IT MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HADNT SEEN WHAT HARRY HAD SEEN IN THE FOREST OR BECAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE SCARS BURNING ON THEIR FOREHEADS BUT RON AND HERMIONE DIDNT SEEM AS WORRIED ABOUT THE STONE AS HARRY THE IDEA OF VOLDEMORT CERTAINLY SCARED THEM BUT HE DIDNT KEEP VISITING THEM IN DREAMS AND THEY WERE SO BUSY WITH THEIR STUDYING THEY DIDNT HAVE MUCH TIME TO
